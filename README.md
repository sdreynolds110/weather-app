# weather-app
When I wake up in the morning, one of the first things I do is check the weather so I know what to expect for the day. With the implementation of this Weather App, I'm not only able to check for useful information for the current day, but also a 5 day forecast, detailing what the next few days will be like. Using information straight from Open Weather, I can see temperatures, humidity, and what kind of precipitation, if any, I should expect.

As a USER,
I want to see what the weather will be like
So that I can dress accordingly

In order to search for a certain forecast, the USER will need to type in a location in the search bar. Doing so will display the appropriate information like the date, temperatures, wind speed, humidity, and a UV index, as well list prior searches below through Local Storage. 

I was able to write up code quickly after reviewing the activities we did in class on API calls, AJAX, and JSON. With the help of activities, as well as classmates and some helpful videos on the internet, I was able to successfully make AJAX calls to display accurate information. Marco Carrillo's breakdown on the Homework tab of Slack was a massive help as well, as he broke down some very important hints on how to complete the homework. The project group I'm in, which includes Lauren Minton, Rob Quinn, and Joe Bailey, all helped each other with some coding as well.
